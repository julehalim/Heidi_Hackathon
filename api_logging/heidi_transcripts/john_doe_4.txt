What brings you in today? Just feeling a bit off lately — low mood, tired all the time. How long has this been going on? A few weeks now, maybe more. Still working? Yeah, but I’ve been dragging myself through the day. Sleeping okay? Not great, waking up a lot. Appetite? Less than usual. Any thoughts of self-harm? No, nothing like that. History of anxiety or depression? I’ve had some anxiety stuff in the past, but never really treated it. Coping strategies? I try to go for walks, but I haven’t felt up to it. Still smoking? Yeah, unfortunately. Alcohol? Maybe 5–6 drinks a week. Want to explore treatment options? Yeah, maybe talking to someone or trying medication. Anything else today? No, that’s all really.
