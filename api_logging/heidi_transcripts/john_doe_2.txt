What brought you in today? I’ve had this cough for like three weeks now and it’s not going away. Is it productive? Yeah, I’m bringing up some clear-ish mucus. Any fever or night sweats? No fever, just some fatigue. Breathing okay? A little wheezy, but not terrible. Any weight loss? Not really. Smoking history? Still half a pack a day. Asthma okay otherwise? Yeah, haven’t needed the puffer much. Any known exposures? No, no sick contacts or anything. Tried anything for it? Just over-the-counter cough syrup, didn’t help. Medications? Still just salbutamol. Anything else? My partner wants me to quit smoking.
