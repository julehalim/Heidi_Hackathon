So, what’s brought you in today? I’ve had lower back pain for about a week now, getting worse. Did it start after anything specific? Yeah, I helped a friend move furniture last weekend. Where’s the pain located? Lower back, more on the right side. Radiate anywhere? Sometimes down my leg, but mostly local. Describe the pain. Achy and stiff, especially in the morning. Any numbness or tingling? No. Bowel or bladder issues? No. Past back issues? Not really, maybe occasional tightness. Medications? Took some ibuprofen, but I ran out. Allergies? None. Working through it? Trying, but sitting at the desk all day makes it worse. Anything else? My sleep’s been off because of it.
