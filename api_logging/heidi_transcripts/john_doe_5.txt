What brings you in today? Just wanted to follow up on how things have been going since last month. How are you feeling now? A bit better — I’ve been seeing the psychologist you referred me to, and it’s helping. Any changes to sleep or mood? Sleep’s still patchy, but mood is more stable. Are you still using any medications? Yeah, I started on sertraline about three weeks ago. Any side effects? Mild nausea at first, but it settled. Still smoking? I cut down to about 3–4 cigarettes a day — trying to quit completely. Great progress. Still drinking? Yeah, but I’ve also cut back a bit. Anything else on your mind today? No, just wanted to check in and make sure I’m on the right track. Absolutely, it sounds like you are — let’s keep monitoring how things go.
